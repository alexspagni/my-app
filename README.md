# my-app
I'm develpoing an app that is going to show some image about mars rover.
My app has for now three different screen, the first one shows some predefinite images querying to Nasa API. if you tap on a image you will see some detail about image, for example
his id. 
You can also search an image clicking on a magnifying glass that render you on another screen where you can search image by date or by name
